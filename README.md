**Applied Data Science Capstone**

**Project Scenario**

I spearheaded the analysis and pricing strategy for rocket launches, enabling the company to compete effectively with established players like SpaceX. Leveraging machine learning models and comprehensive data analysis, I determined optimal launch prices and predicted the reusability of first-stage rockets. Additionally, I developed dynamic dashboards to provide real-time insights to the team, facilitating informed decision-making.
